    About
    =====
    
    Hello! I'm **Alex Kern**. You can call me **Kern**.
    
    I'm a dedicated 16-year-old web developer with a lot of strong opinions
    (yes, I am still in high school). I tend to take sides in arguments and
    design sites according to what makes sense to me rather than what's
    considered the norm. I'm a fan of minimalist design and
    [agile development](http://agilemanifesto.org/) techniques. Hard problems
    make me excited.
    
    I am a perfectionist. Small inconsistencies bother the crap out of me,
    *especially* when people just accept these inconsistencies. I pride myself
    on rethinking age-old problems and looking for alternative and possibly far
    more consistent ways of both programming and designing a rather simple
    website.
    
    Everything I have learned is self-taught. I gain advice from
    [mentors](http://www.satisfice.com/) but am strongly self-motivated to learn
    about the latest programming technologies (though, I'm *not* a programming
    hipster). New, shiny code interests me. Especially when it's
    [open source](http://github.com/CapnKernul).
    
    I'm [@CapnKernul](http://twitter.com/capnkernul) over on Twitter. I tend to
    respond fairly quickly to any direct messages I get there. If you're into
    old-school email or just can't comprehend the 140 character limit, you can
    [email me](mailto:alex@kernul.com).

    Skills
    ------------------
    
    I'm proficient in anything Ruby or Rails related. Unfortunately, I'm
    also quite well versed in PHP, though I wouldn't ever go back to those days.
    I am an HTML, CSS, and Javascript ninja, though I tend to do most of my work
    these days in HAML, SASS, and jQuery. My fort&eacute; is programming RESTful
    web services.

    Programming philosophy
    ---------------------
    
    If any of these bother you, then I may not be a good match for your team. If
    these happen to describe the exact qualities that you're looking for, I'm
    your man!
    
     * Communication within the team makes or breaks the project
     * Consistency is important - both for coding standards and branding
     * Use the right tool for the job - specific technologies should never be part of the requirements
     * Everyone on a team should have full commit rights to the same [Git repository](http://github.com)
     * Eat your own dog food - you should be part of your target audience
     * and pretty much everything else in [Rework](http://37signals.com/rework/)
