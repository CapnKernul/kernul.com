I'm *Alex Kern*, a software developer and computer science student at UC Berkeley. For the last 9 years, I've been programming robots and crafting web applications. I focus on building awesome software in Clojure, Ruby, and JavaScript.

I interned for [NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory][jpl], working on the [Mars Science Laboratory][msl] and developing novel data storage techniques. Before attending Berkeley, I was the lead developer at Artcentric Networks, a Los Angeles web startup. In my spare time, I hack on open source projects, all of which can be found on [my GitHub][github].
