I'm *Alex Kern*, a software developer and computer science student at UC Berkeley. I taught myself to program in C at nine, Java at eleven, and Ruby at fourteen. I focus on building awesome software in Ruby and JavaScript.

I've interned for [NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory][jpl], working on the [Mars Science Laboratory][msl] and developing novel data storage techniques. Before attending Berkeley, I was the lead developer at Artcentric Networks, a Los Angeles web startup. I hack on quite a few open source projects, all of which can be found on [my GitHub][github].

Want to talk? You can find me on [Twitter][twitter] or [email me][email]. I respond pretty quickly. Interested in hiring me? Check out my [HTML][html-resume] or [PDF resume][pdf-resume].
