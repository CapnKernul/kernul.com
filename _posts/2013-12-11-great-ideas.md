While developing [Clique](http://cliqueapp.com), Greg and I have begun frequenting a local café named [Babette](http://babettecafe.com/), tucked away in the Berkeley Art Museum. We've become friends with the owners, a sweet couple that happens to make incredible carnitas tacos. I'm pretty sure I spend more time programming there than I spend in class.

Consider working out of a coffee shop before confining yourself to a cube. If your company is small enough, a café might be better than any space you can buy.
